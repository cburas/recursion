# recursion
Trying to figure out if I can't understand recursion or if it was the math in our exercise that stopped me.

In DevBootcamp we had two exercises where we were being taught about recursion and call stack. I was unable to even figure out how to iterate through the factorials. I looked at what Craig and I did last time so that exercise is useless to me at the moment for learning.

The goal is to single out which is the issue: math or recursion

First Challenge:

The first challenge is to create a method which can reverse a string. This will be called 'reverse_string.rb' 

Second Challenge:

The second challenge is to create a palindrome checker. It will take a string and see if it is the same word if read both ways. This file will be called 'palidrome_checker.rb'


Annnnd go!
